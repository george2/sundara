  <h3>
   For a beautiful web.
  </h3>
  <h2>
   What is it?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Sundara jāla is (yet another) static website generator. It may not be
   better than any other generator, and it may not do what you want it to.
   It does, however, do exactly what I need.
  </p>
  <h2>
   So what does it do?
  </h2>
  <p>
   At its most basic level, Sundara is a markdown to HTML5 converter. It
   was designed to allow easy and extremely customizable creation of
   standards-compliant HTML5 websites, beautiful both to the end user and
   under the hood.
  </p>
  <p>
   The stated goals of this project are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    To output perfectly formed HTML5 web pages.
   </li>
   <li>
    To integrate with Bootstrap and jQuery to provide end-user eye candy.
   </li>
   <li>
    To maintain seperation of code, style and content.
   </li>
   <li>
    To simplify the process of creating and maintaining a website.
   </li>
   <li>
    To allow any level of customization without sacrificing simplicity.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   What does the name mean?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Sundara jāla can be translated (more or less literally) from Sanskrit as
   "beautiful web." (But I don't know Sanskrit, and am relying solely on
   online translators, so don't quote me on that.)
  </p>

   Usage

  <h3>
   Command syntax
  </h3>
  <p>
   Starting development on a new website is easy:
  </p>
  <pre><code>sundara init mywebsite
</code></pre>
  <p>
   Or:
  </p>
  <pre><code>cd mywebsite
sundara init
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The main purpose of Sundara is to generate websites, so presumably
   at some point you will want to do this. To have Sundara read in all
   your wonderful content and beautiful style documents and spit out
   a shiny new website, run:
  </p>
  <pre><code>sundara generate
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The site files will be placed in the
   <code>
    www\
   </code>
   subdirectory by default.
   You should never need to edit these files (if you do, all your
   changes will be overwritten the next time you run
   <code>
    sundara generate
   </code>
   ).
   Just copy them directly on to your web server, and you're ready to go.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you need to change the default site directory to something else (to
   avoid conflicts with a subdirectory in your site, for example), just
   tell Sundara where to put the files explicitly:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ sundara generate mywwwwfiles
</code></pre>
  <p>
   Sundara comes with a small built-in development server, so you can test
   your changes instantly:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ sundara server [[ip_address:]port]
</code></pre>
  <p>
   By default, the server binds to 127.0.0.1:8080. Note that the
   server's root is set to the
   <code>
    www\
   </code>
   subdirectory, so you should
   run
   <code>
    sundara generate
   </code>
   first to create/update those files.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Creating content
  </h3>
  <p>
   Sundara uses git to find files you have added to your git repository.
   Any file that ends with
   <code>
    .md
   </code>
   is assumed to be a webpage, and will be
   added to your site.
  </p>
  <p>
   To start with, you will probably want a homepage; create index.md with
   your content, and add it to the git index:
  </p>
  <pre><code>git add index.md
</code></pre>
  <p>
   For other markdown files, sundara will use the filename, minus the
   <code>
    .md
   </code>
   extension, to decide where to place the file in your website.
   For example, if you create a file called
   <code>
    about.md
   </code>
   that contains
   content for your About page, then add that file to Sundara and
   generate your website:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ sundara add about.md
$ sundara generate
</code></pre>
  <p>
   You will be able to access the new page (once you put it on your
   server, of course) as
   <a href="">
    http://yoursite.com/about
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   But what if you want to add subdirectories to your site? Well,
   Sundara supports that too:
  </p>
  <pre><code>git add mysubdir/mynewpage.md
sundara generate
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The new page will be placed on your site as
   <a href="">
    http://yoursite.com/mysubdir/mynewpage
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <h3>
   Changing the look of your site
  </h3>
  <p>
   Websites generated with Sundara will use the generic bootstrap CSS
   files by default. If you want to do some bootstrap subclassing,
   or even remove bootstrap altogether and use your own stylesheets,
   you can do that too.
