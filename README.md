# Sundara jāla
## For a beautiful web.

### What is it?
Sundara jāla is (yet another) static website generator. It may not be
better than any other generator, and it may not do what you want it to.
It does, however, do exactly what I need.

### So what does it do?
At its most basic level, Sandara is a markdown to HTML5 converter. It
was designed to allow easy and extremely customizable creation of
standards-compliant HTML5 websites, beautiful both to the end user and
under the hood.

The stated goals of this project are as follows:
* To output perfectly formed HTML5 web pages.
* To integrate with Bootstrap and jQuery to provide end-user eye candy.
* To maintain seperation of code, style and content.
* To simplify the process of creating and maintaining a website.
* To allow any level of customization without sacrificing simplicity.

### What does the name mean?
Sundara jāla can be translated (more or less literally) from Sanskrit as
"beautiful web." I don't know Sanskrit, and am relying solely on online
translators, so don't quote me on that.

### Installation


### Usage


### Hacking
The source is Python 3, and is freely available under a "New BSD" or
"BSD 3-clause" license. You are encouraged, but not required, to
contribute any changes you make back to the project. The development
cycle for Sundara most closely resembles git-flow; in other words,
please DO NOT submit pull requests to the `master` branch.

Have fun!
